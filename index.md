### CPSC 120
* Lab 2
    Lab 2 Part 1 is one of my favorite labs because it was my first time actually coding. Lab 2 introduced me to how GitHub worked. It also made me familiar with how to compile and fix errors, along with formatting. 
* Lab 5
    Lab 5 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs; I found it fun to input the ingredients and then have the output be the sandwhich it made. I also enjoyed using command line arguments for this lab.
* Lab 7
    I enjoyed working on Lab 7 Part 2 I found this lab entertaining to code. I also liked using functions since it was the first time I had used them in a lab.
